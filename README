jssf
====

Java implementation of Delwink's Side Scroller Format.

Build
-----

The NetBeans IDE is used in developing this library, which generates `ant`
build scripts by default. You can either load the project in NetBeans yourself,
or you can build with `ant` like so:

    $ ant clean jar

The environment variable `JAVA_HOME` needs to point to a valid JDK for the
command-line build to work.

Hacking
-------

jssf uses the [Sun coding style][1] for Java with a soft limit of 79 columns in
the source code.
